## Sorting Students into Random Groups

<a href="https://github.com/rschauner/student-pairs" target="_blank">Code on GitHub</a><br>

A simple project to make a CLI and GUI to sort students into groups using Rust.
The purpose was:

- I wanted for someone to be able to run this without having R or Python installed,

- I wanted to learn a little bit of a compiled language, and

- My fiance√© had a use for such a utility.
