## *O*-GlcNAcylation in AML

A project focused on implicating the Hexoseamine Biosynthetic Pathway and *O*-GlcNAcylation in AML.
We collected a large amount of publicly available data from NCI, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and the NIH GEO
to investigate expression of Hexoseamine Biosynthetic Pathway members across AML patient samples and healthy controls.

## Sorting Students into Random Groups

A simple project to make a CLI and GUI to sort students into groups using Rust.
The purpose was:

- I wanted for someone to be able to run this without having R or Python installed,

- Learn a little bit of a compiled language, and

- My fiance√© had a use for such a utility.
